# GottaBe
A simple multi-platform builder for c++.

## Introduction

All tools for building c++ projects may be in the most cases a painful task to accomplish. You have to deal with a lot of complexity which could be avoided if you had a tool that would do it for you.
There are good tools to build and they do it very well, but if you change a little the configurations you will have a lot of trouble.

The idea of GottaBe is to stay simple in all cases.

## Manual

The syntax for using GottaBe is very simple and doesn't need to much parameters. You just need to tell it what to do and it will do. You must call GottaBe in a directory which has a build descriptor, a build.json file.

```
    gottabe build
```
The command line above will build your project.
